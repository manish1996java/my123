welcome guys 
we have already compleated our nav now
today we are going to create our css3
carousal we also do media query , bootstrap

lets create a carousal.
first lets see on paint that how carousal
real works in our web page

first we will create a div with id 
carousal and inside we will create 
a slider.

a slider is the part that move right to
left and we will add our animation on this
slider.

and inside the slider we have images let
suppose five image.

and our div with carousal id width is 
100 %;

you can see all these image comes from
out side of window. from right side.
it mean one image will be show on window and 
reamining four image will be out side of
window.

so you can see this front image is taking 100% 
of width. it mean every image in the 
slider will take 100% width.

now if we have 5 images
it mean we need 5*100width = 500% width

so already have carousla having 100% width
inside we have slider and we will give 
500% width according to contain 5 images
with 100% width,
inside we will create div with image id
and inside this image div we create a
img tag and inside its source attribute 
we will give the path of image



here we write a css for animation .
for animation we will use animation 
property and @keyframe or some css
properties.


with help of css properties and with
key frames.

css3 come with key frame by which you
can give animation to our css element

keyframe-based animations that allow
you to specify the changes in css 
properties over time as a set of keyframes

first you need define





<timing-function> = ease | linear | ease-in
| ease-out | ease-in-out | step-start |
step-end | steps(<integer>[, [ start | 
end ] ]?) 


Media query
Media queries are useful when you 
want to modify your site or app 
depending on a device's 

you just add @media(min-width:1200px)
@media(max-width:1200px)

you can add either min-width or
max width.

in min-width if you give any 
pixel width it work equal 
greater to this pixel

and opposite for max-width if 
you give any pixel width .it work
equal or smaller 
to this pixel.


/* In media queries min-width: X is 
true if the viewport has a width 
greater or equal to X */


/* In media queries max-width: X is 
true if the viewport has a width
smaller or equal to X */

some of common breakpoints is 
on 1200px width
992px
768px
480px
320px


you also can add breakpoints 
according to you . on the point
where your website break.

topic of html and css . now you can
complete this website by own.

html css js for building beatiful
