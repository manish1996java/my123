hey guys.
today we have to complete our flipkart website.
header or navigation bar.
after that if time will left then we will also 
create a carousle .

carousle is the image slider in the flipkart
down navigation bar.

you can see every shoping and other website 
using this carousle to make our our website 
more attractive.

when we move to bootstrap then we don't need 
to do all these things. bootstrap already 
have some class which is do this all thing 
in behind the sean. we just need to add 
classes on our elements.

but we also need to know that how everything
is working form very basic.

so lets start to create our navigation bar


in navigation bar you can see that their is
a list .list of option and here you also can
see a clickable text.

so we need to create a list , so we will pick
unorderd list. or inside unorderd list and
li we will create a anchor tag for clickable 
text then inside we will write these option.


so lets understand into paint.




so lets impelements into code.
