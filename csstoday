hey guys.

good. and how about you.

lets start this session.
before starting ,
i want to tell you that you
can get these codes from my git hub link.

here is my github link.

you can note it.


so
today we have to complete our flipkart website.
header or navigation bar.
after that if time will left then we will also 
create a carousle .
carousle is the image slider in the flipkart
down navigation bar.

you can see every shoping and other website 
using this carousle to make our our website 
more attractive.

when we move to bootstrap then we don't need 
to do all these things. bootstrap already 
have some class or components for all this
.which is do this all thing 
in behind the sean. we just need to add 
classes on our elements.

but we also need to know that how everything
is working form very basic.

so lets start to create our navigation bar


in navigation bar you can see that their is
a list .list of option and here you also can
see a clickable text.

so we need to create a list , so we will pick
unorderd list. or inside unorderd list and
li we will create a anchor tag for clickable 
text then inside we will write these option.


so lets understand into paint.


so first we will add box-sizing : border-box;
now what border do 

let see with the diagram

if i give margin or padding to any element 

let say we have any element 
and the
and the width of element is 100 px
this is actuall size of element 
then if add padding to this element 
let say 3px 3px padding
and if i add 10 10 px marging
now our element size is increase then our 
actuall element size 


now the size is 100px width + 3 + 3 padding
in both side or margin 10px+10px in both size
now the element size is  = 126


if i don't want that our element take much width
then our actuall size 

then i give box-sizing: border-box;

now what it will do

let say again we have element with 100px width:
or again 3px 3px padding in both side or margin
now this property will manage these extra pixels
in its element size

now the paddng 3+3px = 6px
or the marging 10+10px =20px

these margin padding take space in the 100 px width 
and you will the width is still 100px;

but actuall extra 26px is adjusted in 84px + 26px =100px;



now lets implement this property in universal
select because i want that our element 
don't take extra width then our 
window width.




so lets impelements into code.











now lets create a carousal .
so lets understand into paint.
