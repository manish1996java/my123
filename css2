hey, guys lets start this session.

in previous session 
we have covered :

selectors
introduction of css.
5 types of position.
display block, inline or inline-block
pseudo element or classes 
and we were doing 
floating and clear fix.

now we have to complete the floating and clear fix.

now lets complete the code where we left.
there was no problem in the code 
after ending the previous session i 
run this code again and its worked.

so lets see again how 

clear:left
clear:right
clear:both

work with floating

we already have a container
inside container div we  have col1 and
col2 div

then we have created p tag and the 
element taking place around the floating
elements

but we don't want that ptag take space 
around them

then we created div with class space 
next to the col2 element

and div is block element which will occupy
full width of our window but without any
content it will not taking any width and
height. 

we can add property content ="";
or either we can give width and height.
and then we will add property clear:left
for all left floating element


now you can see its work for left element
and clear remaing area according to left
elements height.

and you can do the same thing for right element

and if i want for both then 
add value clear : both;



we can also use these clearfix with class selector

benefit of using class selector wherever i want this
property in our element we just need to add class 
name to particular element . and then property 
will apply.

now will create class name with


.clearfix::after now here after will create 
fake element wherever i add this class to 
any element.

now we don't need to add class after floating
element like we created div with space class.

now we don't need to create this class .
now after pseudo element will autometically
do for us.

.clearfix::after{
  content: "";
  display:block;
  clear:both;
}




by default after create a inline element 
but we need a block element 


now we need to create row class and inside row
i will contain all these column

now we just need to simply add this clearfix to 
the row class.

now it will work same.

you alos can do one more thing that you can
change clearfix name with row
and then whenever you create div with class
row it will apply


now
css3 replace this floating and 
clearfix with display flex .display
flex do all these things .we 
just need to apply this property on
parent div and the child elements
will automatically seperate as a
column.we also need to define width
of all column.



Now we are ready to create a website.
lets create replica of flipkart.


now will also maintaining standard that
where we will contain all our css file.
js files and images.

all website are follow these standard


first we will create file with project
name .we are creating flipkart website
so i give a name flipkart and inside.
we will create index.html . now Question 
is why i give a name index. 


when you do live on server. then server
will don't know that what name could be
of your webpage. even it also don't know
that what name every developer will give
to our website

so server said i have file where i mentioned
the names.and i will run the files bases on
these names.

and you must follow these rule then i run 
your website.

some of name are :

index.html
index.htm
index.jsp


then server 
finding name


you can also change these name with our 
webpage name in server file in web.xml
but 

by default these name were written.

then we will create Assets folder
where i store all css ,js or otherfiles

now i am creating two files here

first for image 
and second for cssfiles
