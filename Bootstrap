hey guys!

lets start this session.
we have completed our html and css.
today we will integrate a bootstrap.
now.

bootstrap is open-source framework 
on html ,css, java script and created
by twitter and its enable you to 
create resposive or mobile first,
website. mobile first because it
will give you websit to look great
in mobile view.

Bootstrap has standard set of classes
that allow you to creat quick and 
beautiful web application

lets start with container

this is basic component
bootstrap create a class container
if you put this class then you will 
will see it will take some margin 
from left and right.

now here we don't need to use
margin: 0 auto;

behind the sean bootstrap is doing 
the same thing.

now we don't need to create a class
for this margin: 0 auto;

if you don't want margin from
left and right. 
then you just need to add

container-fluid.

then it will take full width of window.


now in bootstrap we have grid system.
in css3 we have displayflex.

and we are using this display flex in 
.row class{
  display: flex;
}

now in bootstrap already has a row class.
you just need to add this class to
our element.

and here we add our content or you can 
say column.

and column must be the intermadiate child 
of row then it will work.

and one more thing here you may contain 
12 column in per row.

but sum of column width must be equal to 
12 

if it is greater then >12 then the column 
will sift to next line 

there are multiple width of column 
1 to 12;

and every colmn with different number 
having different width.

col-1 having 8.3% with out of 100%;
in col-2 having 2 times greater as same
col-3 haveing 3 times greter and so on.

last we have col-12 which will take full
width of screen.

now if we to make it resposive.
in css we were using media query . now 
here we have class.
like 

col-default auto
col-sm for mobile view    break point =>540px 
col-md for table view     break point =>720px
col-lg for desktop view   break point =>960px
col-xl for large view     break point =>1140

internally they are using @media(min-width:)
